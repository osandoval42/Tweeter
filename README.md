[Tweeter.Solutions](http://tweeter.solutions/)

Inspired by Twitter and the beautiful birds of the world, Tweeter.Solutions is a full stack web application deployed on AWS.  A Node.js Express server interfaces with a MongoDB NoSQL database through Mongoose ODM to present a RESTful API to the front end.  Coupled with a Redux architectural framework, React.js sits on the client side providing a seamless, real-time user experience via AJAX calls to Node.  Sessions are created, maintained and destroyed using industry standard Passport.js middleware.
